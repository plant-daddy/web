      'Aeonium is a genus including about 35 succulent plant species with unusually glossy, waxy leaves arranged in rosettes. The species range from the low-growing A. tabuliforme and A. smithii, just a few inches across, to large species several feet across, such as A. arboreum, A. valverdense, and A. holochrysum. The leaves and structure of the plant are so perfect that these species are sometimes mistaken for artificial plants.The leaves of Aeoniums are typically rounded and arranged in rosettes around center hubs at the end of stems. The foliage can be a solid color, or variegated in white, yellow, red, and green. Small, star-like flowers grow in clusters from the center of the rosettes, but they are not particularly showy. The fleshy leaves make these plants quite similar to several other succulent plants, most noticeably Echeveria and Sempervivum—the popular hens and chicks.Aeoniums can be planted in the garden at any time. These are rather slow-growing plants, and it may take as much as five years before they bloom.The Spruce / Kara Riley',

      "The Aerangis genus comprises many tropical orchids which can be distinguished by their lovely white, star-shaped flowers. The genus contains about 50 plants, and though they mostly originate in tropical regions of Africa, a few are also native to the islands of the Indian ocean. Aerangis orchids, though uncommon in cultivation, are not overly difficult to grow, even by novices. However, they don't react well to sudden environmental changes, and like all orchids, plants are often lost to sudden changes in temperature or humidity.Typically, these orchids are epiphytes—plants that grow attached to trees rather than in soil—and they’re often grown in hanging baskets filled with bark chip/ sphagnum moss mixture. The best and most distinctive feature of an Aerangis plant is its waxy flowers, which are usually white or yellow and shaped like five-pointed stars. Not only do these flowers give off a pleasant aroma, but they also bloom with regularity.A single Aerangis specimen can bear many flowers at once. Their leaves are evergreen, and their spurs contain nectar that is pleasing to birds. Despite their relative rarity, several species of Aerangis plants, such as A. citrata, are sometimes grown by hobbyists, and there are also a few hybrids available to orchid aficionados and botanical experts. Gardeners who can mimic the tropical conditions in which the Aerangis orchid thrives will want to consider this understated and pleasant genus.",

      'African fern pine is a conifer with long, narrow leaves, native to eastern Africa. In appropriate North American climates, it can be used as a moderately tall landscape tree, but it also accepts hard pruning and is sometimes used for a hedge plant.Originally assigned the botanical name Podocarpus gracilior, the fern pine has been reclassified as Afrocarpus gracilior by some botanists. The fern pine is still generally sold under the name of Podocarpus gracilior, and literature may still refers to it by the former scientific name.The fern pine produces clusters of slender light green leaves that darken as they mature. The evergreen leaves are irregularly spaced and grow up to 4 inches in length at maturity. It is the airy, fern-like appearance of the foliage that makes this a desirable tree or hedge shrub. The flowers of this species are yellow and not conspicuous. Instead of a traditional cone, the tree produces a small fleshy fruit containing a single seed. The berry-like fruits are green in color, turning to yellow as they ripen.Fern pines develop a single upright trunk with a dense canopy that, when properly trimmed, produces a rounded or oval shape. When allowed to grow in tree form, it will eventually reach a height of up to 60 feet. Over time it will spread to a width of 25 to 35 feet, casting dense shade. The trunk will grow to a size of 2 feet or more in diameter. If kept as a shrub or hedge, the fern pine is usually clipped so it does not exceed a height of 20 feet. Young specimens have even been successfully trained as wall espaliers. African fern pine has a moderate growth rate that will add 12 to 36 inches a year, and it can be quite long-lived, surviving up to 150 years.',

Native to Europe, the low-growing foliage grows quickly, covering the ground with tiny cross-shaped, four-petal flowers within two months of being planted. Its gray-green leaves are slightly hairy, narrow, and lance-shaped.Easy to grow from plant or seed, sweet alyssum is a cool-season flower that can be set out in early spring once all danger of frost has passed (in frost-free climates, sweet alyssum can also be grown throughout the fall and winter).

If your region is especially hot and dry, a slightly shaded area will work best for this plant, though you should keep in mind that it can get stem rot or leaf blight if too much shade prevents the leaves and soil from completely drying out. Generally, you should aim to plant your sweet alyssum somewhere where it can get six to eight hours of sunlight a day.',
    soil: "Sweet alyssum plants prefer soils that are of medium moisture and well-draining. They're tolerant of many different planting locations and can even be found on sandy beaches and dunes—though they can also grow on cultivated fields, walls, slopes, and even in cracks in sidewalks or walls. The plants will do poorly in boggy soil or where drainage is a particular problem.",

      'Provide your sweet alyssum plants with at least an inch of water every week, watering them more frequently during hot or dry spells. Make sure the water drains well, otherwise the plant is susceptible to rot.

      'In temperate weather, gardeners may be able to grow sweet alyssum all year long, though the actual plants themselves are short-lived. Typically, they self-seed so much that while it seems as though the same plants are surviving all year long, the reality is that new seedlings are filling in. Sweet alyssum plants repeat bloom, although many varieties tend to stop flowering in heat, only to often pick back up again in the fall. In areas of high humidity, you should compensate by reducing the amount of water given to plants.',

      'The Amaranthus genus is a complicated one, featuring at least 75 annual and perennial species that easily cross-breed and hybridize. Today, most gardeners are familiar with the species as ornamental plants, and many don\'t even realize that amaranths are also edible plants that can be grown for their grain-like seeds and edible leaves. In fact, this was once the primary reason amaranth served as a staple in home cottage gardens. Historically, the use of amaranth as an ornamental plant is a relatively recent development.Edible amaranth is often grown for the plentiful tiny seeds that hang in tassels from the top of the plant after the attractive red flowers fade. The bulk seed is used as a "grain" in porridges or added as a thickener to soups and stews. The seeds are extremely nutritious and protein-packed, with a slightly nutty flavor. You can also use the leaves of amaranth as a leafy vegetable; the taste is similar to spinach and it can be used in the same way as many other leafy vegetables, especially in mixed-green salads.If consumption is the goal, choose annual amaranth varieties marketed as edibles. Nearly all amaranths are edible, including love-lies-bleeding and even the common road-side weedy forms. But those sold as edible varieties are selected for their good seed production and especially tasty leaves.Amaranth is native to North America and Central America, and is usually planted from seed as soon as the last frost has passed in the spring. If you are eager for early harvest, you can start the seeds indoors as much as eight weeks earlier. If you want to harvest the plants for seeds, it will take about 12 weeks for the plants to reach full maturity. Leaves can be harvested within a few weeks of outdoor planting.',

But amaryllis bulbs are often purchased to grow as potted plants for holiday bloom, which is only possible if you plant the dormant bulbs at precisely the right time—about 10 to 12 weeks before desired bloom time. When you buy commercial bulbs from a grower for Christmas bloom, these are dormant bulbs that should be kept cool until the right planting time.If you already have potted amaryllis plants, future blooms can be controlled by setting the plant outdoors to grow through the summer, then bringing it indoors and forcing them into a short period of dormancy by withholding water and fertilizer for several weeks, then restarting the bulbs.',

      'Flowering ornamentals are a reminder of a new spring for so many, and Magnolias are some of the best reminders of the new season that we have. Among a genus that is known for its beauty, some species can take your breath away and others just make you want to breathe it all in. The stunning Japanese native, Anise Magnolia, dazzles your eyes with white, delicate, star-like blossoms that are pre-cursors to the leaves of this deciduous magnolia. The flowers themselves provide enough of a wow factor, but as you come within range of the aroma, you will be surrounded by the mixture of an anise-lemon smell that is intoxicating. Even the bark will provide you with the fragrance when scratched.To identify anise magnolia, besides the aroma, you can look for the blooms. The flowers are six-sided “petals” called tepals, with a hint of pink at the base. Its flowers blossom from bare branches in the early spring before the leaves unfurl.The leaves are thin and willow-like, which is where the plant gets its botanical name. Salicifolia is a Latin word meaning willow-leafed. The leaves are unlike most other magnolias, so this is another easy way to identify the tree beside the aroma.In the late summer, it bears fruits which are interesting to look at even before they ripen to startling red seed pods. They contrast with the dark green of the tree’s leaves. Later, In the fall the leaves turn a shocking golden-yellow before they are shed in the cooler weather. This is when the warming scents of lemon are given off by a scratch and sniff session on the aromatic bark, now unhindered by foliage.The anise magnolia is available in several cultivars and has been used to parent many hybrid magnolias, most famously Magnolia x kewensis ‘Wada’s Memory’. If lemon and anise are not your favorite scent and you prefer orange blossom, then the hybrid might be for you. The flowers are different as well, being larger, more profuse, and having a tulip shape. Whatever you choose, the original variety, a cultivar, or a hybrid, this tree stands out in a landscape and can provide interest all year round with the assurance that it is deer resistant and does not require frequent pruning.',

    soil: 'The soil you use to plant your magnolia is going to be vital to its success and its best to test it for drainage ability.  Dig a hole 12 inches wide by 12 inches deep in the planting area. Fill the hole with water and let it drain. Then, after it drains, fill it with water again, but, this time, see how long it takes to drain. In well-drained soil, the water will go down at a rate of about one inch an hour. A faster rate, such as in loose, sandy soil, may signal potentially dry site conditions.  A slower rate indicates poor draining soil and is a yellow flag that you may need to improve drainage with amendments, plant in a bed, or look for plants that are more tolerant of wet soil conditions. Acidic soil is best, but that can be handled later with amendments if your soil is not up to par. But testing the soil before planting, so you are ahead of the game, might not be a bad idea.',

There, the peak growing season is from March to May, but if you plant some at home, you can have artichokes maturing throughout the summer. Make sure you have space, though; these are very large plants.The leaves of artichokes are silver-green in color with a long, arching shape. Although they look soft, the leaves can be quite prickly. The stems of the plant are thick and fleshy. The flower buds are the parts that are sold in produce aisles. At the base of the bud is the tender, flavorful artichoke "heart." If allowed to blossom on the plant, artichoke flowers open into large, dome- or muff-shaped purple thistles that are surprisingly fragrant.Artichokes are planted at different times of the year, depending on the climate. Where they are grown as annuals, they must be planted in spring.

If you want to dig up your rhizomes for overwintering, do so before temperatures go below freezing in your area in the fall.',
    fertilizer:
      "Calla lilies need feeding upon planting, and again every spring at the beginning of their growing season, in order to promote bountiful flowering. Most well-balanced fertilizers will work just fine, but avoid choosing a blend with too much nitrogen, which can reduce the plant's flowering.",

      "If you have not seen an Ashe's magnolia in a garden or its native setting you are not alone. The diminutive magnolia with the larger than life leaves and flowers is a rarity. Magnolia ashei is a species of magnolia that baffles botanists to this day. The tree is so perplexing that scientists continuously research why it has not spread past its restrained native range of only six northwest Florida Panhandle counties. The good news is that this stunner is finally catching on and people are learning how to responsibly propagate the Ashe's magnolia for use in the nursery trade. It has gained so much popularity that it was named 2017 plant of the year by the Garden Club of America.  When looking for a tree to purchase or research, you might be directed to the bigleaf magnolia (Magnolia macrophylla). Depending on what botanist is classifying the plant, this is left open for interpretation. Some call Magnolia ashei a subspecies of Magnolia macrophylla. The difference is evident when you see the two next to each other. The tall, M. macrophylla, towers over its stout cousin.  The bigleaf magnolia averages 30-40 feet. An Ashe magnolia grows 15-25 feet. As you can imagine, that is not a mistake you want to make.The Ashe's magnolia has interesting traits that make it desirable to seek out for a garden project, even if it does take a little searching. It is shrubby in form and only grows to about 25 feet but obtains the same width. The tree flowers in a relatively short time after establishing itself, sometimes as little as two years, and is even known to produce flowers in one-gallon containers. It will flower much more if its lateral roots are given room to grow. The tree is also light adaptable in that it possesses unique leaves that allow their size to expand or contract if it is in a lower or higher light area.  The leaves grow to a wow-inducing 24 inches long by 10 inches across. Then the tree starts to produce the sweet-smelling blooms that are creamy-white with purple centers. The blooms can reach up to 15 inches across with 9 lazily drooping tepals (petals on a magnolia tree).   In nature, you will typically find an Ashe's magnolia in ravine slopes and mixed hardwood forests of those six Florida counties. Here they number in the thousands not hundreds of thousands or millions. Sadly, the Ashe's magnolia has been declared endangered. Researchers are worried that the tree is not replenishing its own population and that has them concerned for the Ashe's magnolia’s future in the wild. Adding this tree to your landscape would not just be a great idea aesthetically, it would add horticulture interest and be ecologically friendly too!",

    light:
      "Light is not a major concern to the health of the Ashe's magnolia and will only effect blooms and form. Without full sun, the form of the tree will be spindly and have intermittent blooms. The limbs are heliotropic, the plant moves towards the sun, and its form will be affected greatly by that. Otherwise, there will be no negative health effects. In nature, this is an understory tree and it normally gets dappled sunlight. When it gets an abundance of light it really excels.",
    soil: 'The Ashe magnolia thrives in deep sandy soil types that are well-drained and rich in humus. In its native Florida, there is an abundance of clay and limestone in the soil, so it will really take to soils that mimic those conditions. You do not need to worry about pH unless you are growing your plant in a container.',
    water:
      "Like most other magnolias, once you have helped it get established with a weekly soaking, you can let nature do what it does best. The only time you might need to be concerned is if you are growing your Ashe's magnolia in a container. Then weekly watering is in order if there are dry or drought conditions.",
    temperatureAndHumidity:
      "The Ashe's magnolia is adaptable to a range of climates but does not do well in hot and dry conditions.",
    fertilizer:
      "The Ashe's Magnolia will not need to be fertilized unless you grow it in a container. If you have used a container, then use a slow-release fertilizer. Look for a fertilizer that consists of 15-30-8.",
